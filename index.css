    <p>I never thought I would see myself involved in the law or legislative process(other than voting) but that is
        exactly wheere I ended up the summer of 2019. I was actually a state lobbyist with a non profit called <a
            href="https://younginvincibles.org/">Young Invincibles!</a></p>


    My fast food experience is limited to Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. Both were average but I am convinced Chick-fil-a
    puts something in those sandwiches because edspite eating one almost everyday for a few months I never actually got
    sicl of them. Chitople on the other hand took me almost 3 years to recover from .

    My first "exrta-curricular" experience included this small internship with MCA-<a href="">Musuem of Contemporary
        Art.</a> I was but a small bean but it was a great introduction into both a creative and leadership role that I
    could carry with me for the rest of my experiences.

    Something that I've also <i>technically</i> been doing for a while is volunteering/interning with <a href="">Denver
        Pop Culture Con</a>(Formerly Denver Comic Con.) During the year outside of the con I help with a
    lot of random or organizational things ie. filign last years comments on a panel to see if we'll bring them back,
    handling social media tage when announcing, sorting pictures so we can use them for next year. Whatever we could
    help with to make next year go smoother is what I would do that week. It was a tiring weekend but I also had a good
    amount of fun. Plus I would get to work with a really great teacher I had while I was in high school. The con didn't
    happen this year for obvious reasons but I hope to still continue it in the future.

    Oneof my most recent endeavors was becoming a cna-Certified Nursing Assistant. I took my classes through <a
        href="">Nightingale School of Nursing</a> where I just had a delightfully cute teacher. She was very very detail
    oriented and a little strict sometimes but it just goes to show how high her standards are for those entering the
    medical field. After that I started working at POwerback Rehab where I've gotten a chance to be thrown right into
    everything. I'm overall okay witgh it do far.


    Another current thing I'm involved in is an apprenticeship with <a href="">Home Advisor</a> that I was able to find
    through <a href="">CareerWise</a>. I will never get over saying howgrateful and privilaged I feel to be with them
    and hope I can stay with them a long time. I feel incredibly lucky to have found them and I'm excited to see where
    it can further bring me.


    I've also held two smaller positions that we used an Emily griffiths building for-an internship for a DPStv and an
    editor for Mile High Discussion. They were years apart but overall held the same ideas-a television show made for
    and by students for other students.
